## Flask Setup/Guide:
[Here is a link to the flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
Flask supports Python 3.9 and newer. (python --version)

1. Create a venv
- For Mac/Linux: run `python3 -m venv .venv` in your project directory
- For Windows: run `py -3 -m venv .venv` in your project directory
2. Activate the venv
- Mac/Linux: `. .venv/bin/activate`
- Windows:  `.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Inside the venv, run
- `pip install Flask`
4. Install dependencies
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` <- this installs the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Anytime new dependencies are installed, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update the list of required dependencies.

`flask run --debug` use this to run the app in debug mode, which will auto update the app with any changes you make so you don't have to constantly type the run command.

SECRET_KEY in app.py is for security. Can be generated by doing the following: Create a .env file -> type "python" in your terminal -> type "import secrets" -> type "secrets.token_hex(16) -> type "exit()" -> copy what that gave you into your .env file -> should look like SECRET_KEY='what you got from running the python script

## Register/Login Functionalities:
- Consider adding "remember me" feature
- Consider adding "forgot password?" feature

## Next Steps:
1. Implement DB
2. Implement user logic, ensure register/login and logout functionality
3. Implement dashboard form(s)
4. Implement dashboard calculation logic
5. Implement dashboard display
6. Implement profile/settings: change login information, profile picture (if we even implement this as a feature), dark mode (if we implement it), etc.
